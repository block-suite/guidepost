## What is this?
A guidepost gives you directions. It lets you know where you’re going. It gives you a preview of what’s to come. 

## How does it work?
Guidepost is a block for the upcoming WordPress block editor. The guidepost block is built automatically from your headings. Whenever you add or remove a heading the guidepost block is automatically updated.
