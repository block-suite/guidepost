# Guidepost

A guidepost gives you directions. It lets you know where you’re going. It gives you a preview of what’s to come.

#### How does it work?

Guideposts are magic, no they really are. Whenever you add or remove a heading the guidepost block is automatically updated.

Nesting is done based on which size heading you use. Headings of smaller sizes are automatically nested under ones of larger sizes.

#### I like this, who made it?
