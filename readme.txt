A guidepost gives you directions. It lets you know where you’re going. It gives you a preview of what’s to come.

== Description ==
Guidepost is a block for the upcoming WordPress block editor. The guidepost block is built automatically from your headings. Whenever you add or remove a heading the guidepost block is automatically updated.

Nesting is done based on which size heading you use. Headings of smaller sizes are automatically nested under ones of larger sizes.

== Screenshots ==
1. Add the Guidepost block and everything is taken care of automatically.
